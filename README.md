# TriangleTests

A simple web app inspired by "The Art of Software Testing" by Glenford J. Myers, Corey Sandler, and Tom Badgett
---

*This program reads three integer values from an input dialog. The
three values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program
displays a message that states whether the triangle is scalene,
isosceles, or equilateral.*
